# Alarm Clock

A simple alarm clock - extremely user friendly - has no snooze button - you have to walk away to turn it off forcing you to wake up.

## Inspiration

It was the year 2020, home was the new world, a random survey indicated 69% of the world (excluding me) didn't wake with the first alarm.

## How to begin?

For now, me along with a couple of crazy talented friends are looking for more contributors to work on this project.
* Are you a backend developer? You can help us build a robust backend.
* Are you a frontend developer? You can help us build a sleek UI.
* Are you a designer? Bring your wildest imaginations, collaborate with the front-end developers and bring them to reality.

## What is the goal?

iOS and Android apps working seamlessly on millions of devices.
