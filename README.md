# Alarm Clock

A simple alarm clock - extremely user friendly - has no snooze button - you have to walk away to turn it off forcing you to wake up.

It was, is, and always will be free of ads.

## Inspiration

It was the year 2020, the home was the new world, a random survey indicated 69% of the world (excluding me) didn't wake with the first alarm.

## How to begin?
